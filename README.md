Instructions
1. Either find a photo on google or get it provided from LBE team
2. Copy the image into the Github Repository folder for this project "MCPropertyImages"
3. Adjust the size and ensure the file is less than 200KB, I tend to be on the safe side and try to keep it in that 100-180KB range
4. Ideal size is 800 x 444, but ensure that its less than 200KB some images may require lower ratios to meet that threshold
5. Ensure the file has .jpeg, .png, .jpg, at the end of the file name
6. Open the image link in github
7. Right click and copy image address
8. Paste into LBE Project Master
